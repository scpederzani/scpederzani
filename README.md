I'm a palaeoclimate scientist and archaeologist using stable isotope geochemistry and biomarker analysis to explore the climatic backdrop of recent human evolution. I am currently a postdoctoral scientist at the University of La Laguna. I am an avid R user and love implementing and promoting open and reproducible workflows and analyses in archaeology and palaeoclimate science. I regularly teach R data analysis in formats ranging from R introductory courses to advanced workshops on writing reproducible scientific manuscripts using RMarkdown. 

### What am I up to?

:mortar_board: I will be teaching a 4 day 'Scientific Data Analysis in R' course in late January, wich will take participants from basic R functionalities and structures, through data visualisation, good coding practices, and all the way to writing reproducible manuscripts. The course will be fully online and open to anyone, with priority given to ECRs and people working in the archaeological sciences. Watch this space for concrete announcements!
