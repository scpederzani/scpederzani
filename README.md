I'm a palaeoclimate scientist and archaeologist using stable isotope geochemistry and biomarker analysis to explore the climatic backdrop of recent human evolution. I am currently a postdoctoral scientist at the University of Utah. I am an avid R user and love implementing and promoting open and reproducible workflows and analyses in archaeology and palaeoclimate science. I regularly teach R data analysis in formats ranging from R introductory courses to advanced workshops on writing reproducible scientific manuscripts using Quarto/RMarkdown. 

### What am I up to?

:chart_with_upwards_trend: I am working on an R implementation of [Pryor et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.07.003) equations for estimating palaeotemperatures from mammal bioapatite oxygen stable isotope measurements: [Isotope_Temperature_Calibration](https://github.com/scpederzani/Isotope_Temperature_Calibration). I'm aiming to turn this into an isotope temperature calibration package that will also include functions to implement [Passey et. al (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2004.12.002) inverse modelling (currently in [Oxygen_Inverse_Model](https://github.com/scpederzani/Oxygen_Inverse_Model)). 

:stars: I am writing a color palette R package based on the stunning art of the game [Gris](https://nomada.studio/). It's still early stages, but you can check preliminary palettes and progress at [GRIScolors](https://github.com/scpederzani/GRIScolors)

ü§ì I am transitioning to Quarto from RMarkdown for writing my scientific manuscripts, reports, lab sheets etc. I am making some example documents to teach myself at [Quarto_Learning_Manuscripts](https://github.com/scpederzani/Quarto_Learning_Manuscripts)
